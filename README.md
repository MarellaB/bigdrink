## What is TBD?
TBD is a package manager specifically for Gulp files. It is designed to allow
  people to create and share Gulp files and build off one another. The goal is to
  simplify and streamline the build process so that you can pay less attention
  to the boilerplate and get straight to your million dollar idea. But at the same
  time keep it open enough to fit everyone's needs. If anything, just use this
  to keep track of your own recipes, we won't judge, honest.

## Is TBD just for Gulp files?
For now, yes. Maybe one day we will move on to something bigger, but
  as of right now, just Gulp files.

## Why should I use TBD?
Instead of spending a few hours writing your own "perfect" build process, you
  can download someone else's and get right into working. Not only that, but you
  don't have to worry about missing something, use the most popular coffeescript
  recipe or the fastest sass recipe, it's up to you! Or even find one that
  does both!

Not only that, but you can also keep your own gulp files for use, say your projects
  need a very specific build process, certain things need run first, individual
  modules need installed both globally and locally, etc. TBD lets you write that
  once, and use it across as many projects as you'd like. See
  [private-tbd](https://github.com/MarellaB/bigdrink/wiki/public-tbd) for details.

## How do I install TBD?
We are on npm, so just type " *npm install -g tbd-cli* " in the terminal and you
  are ready to go!

## How do I install a recipe?
We wanted to make it simple, so just type " *drink &lt;recipe-name&gt;* " in the
  terminal and you are ready to go!

For private recipes, type " *drink @username&lt;recipe-name&gt;* " in the terminal,
  keep in mind, you can still access other's recipes so be sure you spell both right.

## How do I download an updated recipe?
You can just type " *drink &lt;recipe-name&gt;* " in the terminal again.
  This will however not overwrite if you download a NEW recipe. You will need
  to delete the old one first.

## So, what's with the name?
I decided that since we were focusing on Gulp, it would be fun to make "The Big Drink"
  a concoction of all the Gulp recipes. Purely a fun title I came up with, that's
  all.

## Can I help?
YES! There are a number of things that still need done. Feel free to look at the
  *projects* and *issues* tabs on github. If you can speed up the node file, or
  clean up the website, don't just say it, do it! I will pay as much attention
  to this as I can, and will go through pull requests and issues as they appear.

One thing that we need that is more important than anything though? A mascot!
  If you have an artists hand and like to draw simple adorable things, email us
  with the title "Mascot Submission" and link what you drew, you may just see it
  on the back of someone's laptop!

## Who made TBD?
Brandon Marella, aka, ME! I am a solo developer so forgive me for bugs or oddities.

"But you say 'we' throughout the documentation!?" This is true, I just feel
  more comfortable writing that, not to mention, if one other person ever
  contributes, I only need to change this one section, and can leave the
  documentation alone.

That being said, this is an open source project! So please, feel free to contribute!
